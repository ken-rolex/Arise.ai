pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
from arise import AIModel

# Load a prebuilt model
model = AIModel.load("image-classification")

# Train the model on custom data
model.train(data_path="/path/to/data")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
print(predictions)
```

## 📌 Usage
Arise.ai is designed for:
- AI Research and Experimentation
- Industrial AI Deployments

## 🔌 API Integration
Arise.ai supports API-based integration for AI models. Example:
```python
from arise import APIManager

# Register API for an AI model
api = APIManager()
api.register_model("GPT-4", "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", api_key="your_api_key")

# Compare model outputs
response = api.compare_models(query="What is AI?", models=["GPT-4", "Claude"])
print(response)
```
